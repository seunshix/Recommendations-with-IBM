### **Introduction**
This project aims to build a robust recommender system for users on the IBM Watson Studio platform. The system will recommend articles to users based on their interaction history and the similarity between the articles. It implements a combination of Rank Based, User-User Collaborative Filtering, and Content Based Recommendations to provide personalized recommendations to each user.

### **Libraries and Installations**
The project is implemented using Python 3.x and the following libraries are used:

- nltk
- numpy
- pandas
- re
- scikit-learn
To run this project, you need to have these libraries installed on your system. If not, you can install them by running the following command in your terminal/command prompt:


    pip install nltk numpy pandas re scikit-learn

### **Data**
The dataset used in this project is a subset of real data from the IBM Watson Studio platform. The data contains information on user interactions with articles, including article titles and article IDs.

### **Methodology**
The following steps are performed in the project to build the recommender system:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: An initial analysis is performed on the data to gain some insights.

2. User-Article Matrix Creation: A user-article interaction matrix is created to represent the interactions between users and articles.

3. Article Similarity Matrix Creation: The similarity between articles is calculated using the dot product.

4. Recommendation Systems:

    - Rank Based Recommendations: Recommendations are made based on the rate at which a user interacts with an article.
    - User-User Based Collaborative Filtering: Recommendations are made based on the neighbors of a user and what they have interacted with.
    - Content Based Recommendations: Recommendations are made based on similar articles a user has interacted with.

5. Matrix Factorization: A matrix decomposition is performed on the user-article matrix to better predict new articles a user might be interested in.

### **Conclusion**
This project showcases the implementation of a basic recommender system. The system uses a combination of different recommendation techniques to provide personalized recommendations to each user. The project can be further improved by incorporating additional features, such as article content or user profiles, and using more advanced algorithms.
